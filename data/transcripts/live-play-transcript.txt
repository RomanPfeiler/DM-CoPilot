2:01
is a stout and officious halfling who runs the establishment with her five daughters and has proven to be an
2:08
excellent hostess it's quite cozy although you have had to share a common
2:13
bunk room with several other adventurers the evening meal was excellent and the atmosphere is pleasant
2:19
somebody left I'm gonna guess no no I
2:25

2:35
for the evening meal is excellent atmosphere is pleasant you are preparing
2:40
to bunk down for the evening when one of free owners daughters peeks into the room she calls a few of the adventures
2:48
including all of you into the hall pardon my interruption says the halfling
2:54
girl named Rhys a chap just came into the common room downstairs and he asked
3:01
me to fetch you something about some coin needing to change hands for an easy job she plays with her curly red hair
3:09
nervously and looks at the group it's
3:18
not right now not right now well they
3:23
heard was some about coin for a [ __ ] what no sir that's not what I said at
3:32
all and she looks at you with a mixture of disgusting and fear why she kill
3:50
okay um there's nobody saying anything she just kind of starts tiptoeing her way out of the room not really
3:58
interested in carrying on a conversation with a weird bird person well let's go
4:07
let's see what she means if they need help we should help everything yeah I
4:18
don't know what happened my PC crash so I'm on my laptop now I'm back okay do
4:24
you need a minute no I'm good I'm back okay um so going into the common room
4:31
all right you see a hooded figure alone
4:36
at a large table he looks up but as he does so he kind of keeps his head low so
4:43
that you can't really see his face and he makes a gesture motioning you all to
4:48
come and sit at his table I walk on over
4:54
and I sit down yeah I don't you yeah okay so that's gonna leave Alvin darlin
5:02
and everyone else standing trust him so
5:09
I'll take a chair but also have to stand don't go to your table yes so um as he
5:20
talked he begins to talk and again the whole time he just keeps his face low you know you could see a bit of his chin
5:28
and you can see that he it's pink flesh and judging by his height you can guess
5:35
that he's he's you know either a human or elf but you can't really tell his
5:42
identity or anything else he speaks in a low voice and he begins to talk he says
5:53
I'm a member of the Harper's and I have a job for you what's that job
6:05
well you see we captured a merchant who was going to illegally purchase a red
6:11
dragon egg I want you guys to pose as the merchant and his hirelings
6:17
and go to the buy site make the transaction and place a magical device
6:23
on one of the sellers so the Harper's can track them back to their place of residence you need like a
6:29
halls or something for that voice bro I'm in disguise you fool don't question
6:35
it just go with it yeah okay I bet that's
6:47
the craziest thing ever what do you mean crazy there's dragons
6:54
everywhere you [ __ ] where have you been okay let's get to the important stuff
6:59
something about money oh yes you see you over there the elf
7:10
you resemble the merchant enough to where you could probably take their place and if you could complete the
7:18
transaction what we would like you to do is give them this and he puts a bag of
7:24
what appears to be diamonds on the table oh no no no no that the woman he says
7:38
these are these are fake diamonds okay but it it's the agreed-upon price or the
7:44
egg that these guys are trying to sell they're basically worthless but they
7:50
should be good enough to pass inspection all we want you to do is recover the egg
7:56
bring it back to me I will be outside of the the teakettle waiting around the
8:03
back after you're finished and you have to take this and he hands you birdperson he hands you
8:10
a little silver pin that has the insignia of harpers on it and he says
8:16
this is like it's a magical homing device if you if you somehow slip it on
8:22
to his person then we'll be able to tell where they're going that's what's important here put put the pin on them
8:30
bringing me the egg and if you do this then I'm willing to pay you 200 gold
8:40
each yeah no no not each come on now this is it shouldn't be that difficult I
8:47
mean like we're expecting to there to be no hostilities between the sellers and
8:53
the buyers no no that's very important okay these are these are criminal types they're very Shady do not use names
9:01
it's the seller the buyer no names so I
9:06
put the pin on me and I tell them have a good day right no you [ __ ] you put the pin on them you
9:14
have to you have to slip it in his pocket or well I'll say load it on him I
9:20
put the pin on me and then I say goodbye
9:27
to them to them he's ready to go no no
9:36
no no hold on hold on oh no we're not ready to go yet are you you there what's
9:42
your name and he points to you spoop I malaria okay malaria you have to be the
9:56
merchant okay so so you take the Diamonds but but you have to this is important the the
10:03
merchants who they're expecting to come and do this trade you say she has a lisp
10:08
so so when you talk you you need to make sure that that you emulate the lisp
10:17
oh I need to speak with a lisp oh go on down looking here it has to be convincing I'm submergence no no it's
10:34
pretty good just a little bit more practice but remember you're not the merchant you're the settler right
10:39
you're the seller so so you want to be the seller okay you guys think you guys
10:57
got this are we good okay yes yeah you
11:04
take the gyms and and one of you bastards needs to take this pin and put
11:10
it on to them on me no no no you shut up
11:16
okay I can't explain it again this time is of the essence they're expecting you
11:21
to be there Oh what time are in like in like 20 minutes you have to go you have
11:26
to go now okay now I haven't even told
11:37
you where you're going okay there's a
11:44
barn on the edge of town it's it's only about a 15 minute walk it's a big
11:49
big-ass burn you can't miss it you just head east down the road and you'll see it okay all right so you guys um begin
12:04
walking down the road and about ten
12:12
minutes go by and you can see the barn off in the distance okay so so as you
12:18
approach the barn maybe I don't know if you guys want to try and plan like who's
12:25
gonna do what or if you just want to go in and balls of the wall wing it did we have a
12:33
road and you think no no what is that my
12:41
good sir I'm not sure either but I hear it's really cool from all the
12:49
way why would anyone ever want to stoop to such a profession as a roll I know
12:58
Wow if this pin is supposed to be put on someone who's really good at doing that
13:07
obviously not a bird person but we're actually really bad at that in bird
13:13
culture that's one of our pin really good you're really bad at putting pins on people well just putting pins on in
13:19
general and I just put the pin down is
13:41
it supposed to be a secret that we're putting the pin on the person yes yes no
13:46
we don't want them to know we're following them Oh technically we are not
13:53
the ones following once we don't have the pin is someone else fall we just got to go in and get dragon egg or something
13:59
right and find the buyer right okay
14:06
aren't we the buyer we're little in distilling the seller okay if you alone
14:16
here so who's got the pin [ __ ] fine now
14:21
I left it depend I'll pick it up okay I
14:28
don't want anyone to see me pick it up all right well with the 24 you'd have
14:33
you stooped down and you swipe it and you were carrying it nobody's seen you grab it except everybody heard you say
14:40
you have it but you just pretend you don't know that okay so I don't have a wig 2gm button so
14:46
you don't uh if you click your token oh
14:51
you're the tokens not their cap okay token yeah I just haven't placed them
14:59
yet oh okay okay uh 21 walk to the barn and
15:04
I'm gonna put you on another map now alright and on this map that I'm going
15:13
to have you all on do did you
15:20
[Music] birdperson move you back whoops not spin
15:27
you around move you back a little bit Who am I missing very and here in since I blend in with
15:42
the background of my camouflage negative
15:47
okay so you walk into the barn right and and I want to describe what you're
15:53
looking at everybody can see correct yes okay good
16:00
the barn is about 40 feet wide right I
16:06
know it says 35 it is because it measures from the center of the square instead of the edge and it's about 80 feet long in the back of the barn
16:16
there's a ladder that goes up about ten feet and there is a loft hanging above
16:23
it okay as soon as you enter you see you
16:30
see a sinewy elf in grey clothes holds up his hand and motions for you all to
16:36
stop and he's got three guards flanking him alright
16:44
he turns to the guards with a big smile and he says I told you they would come
16:49
a dragon egg a dragon egg is much too valuable too so he turns his attention back to the
16:57
group said now let's do this quickly here is what you asked for and he holds
17:02
out a very large hide backpack I move
17:18
forward to add to examine you just wait
17:24
right there you don't know need to come closer you throw the payment over to me and we will
17:31
leave the egg right here on the ground we will exit the barn then you can leave after five minutes is past no fuss no
17:38
muss nobody sees us together and you
17:44
know yes you just stay right there ah well we need to verify what's in the
17:51
bag it's the egg is in the bag what do you mean show it to us I don't I don't know
18:02
if I should if I should just show it to you you know I don't how do I know you're not gonna try to do something
18:09
Shady my lady you brought me along to
18:14
their fire dragon egg and I'm not gonna get to see the dragon egg before you make payment that does not see correct
18:23
he's obviously you know nervous and unsure of what to do so he unsent just
18:30
the bag and he holds them out of the bag open and he kind of holds it for you to see right from went from where he is
18:37
halfway across the room and he's like you see there's an egg and he quickly
18:42
stitches the bag back up and he's like okay not good throw me the diamonds I
18:56
think you should pay him if people not let me inspect the merchandise we are purchasing before you make the payment I
19:04
agree I agree and I want to try and do I guess I'd
19:14
like to try in intimidation check to try and intimidate him into showing us so
19:20
that we can really verify what the egg is okay roll roll the check hey actually
19:28
so what do you say as you try to intimidate him with unless I look at
19:34
their group and then I look at our group and I say well we have a pretty solid
19:41
group here well we're asking you very politely to show us the egg so that we
19:48
can confirm now I can ask you not so politely okay so he his eyes go wide and
19:55
he's like oh you know I do okay and he starts reaching the bag to pull Diego
20:01
but then he kind of stops he goes wait a minute there's something different about
20:06
you so didn't you used to have a lisp
20:13
I'm just being polite wait and now it's
20:19
back in bird culture lisps are very
20:32
common we have potions we make there's a nice
20:42
tray not like he's stroking his chin
20:55
looking warily at you malaria
21:02
easily hmm I don't know here he reaches into the bag and he
21:09
pulls out and it's an object it's roughly it's roughly a foot and a half
21:16
feet tall and it's about you know two
21:21
feet in diameter and it's it's an egg and it's very red it definitely
21:30
definitely looks like a dragon egg he's
21:37
like are you satisfied can we please get on with this already milady at this
21:43
range I cannot make positive identification whether that is a dragon eater does he's gonna need to let me
21:49
look at it closer before I can give you a definite yes or no I want to try and
21:55
convince him to bring the dragon egg over to us okay
22:02
so what is that and what are you saying
22:07
and you're sure we leave lots of eggs
22:13
you know because we're birds so we we have a pretty good understanding of eggs
22:19
and my friend here knows a lot about dragon eggs so if you want to just come
22:25
on over with that and let us take a closer look that'd be greatly appreciated he's like I I don't
22:43
understand I don't understand like there's something very strange here I
22:48
can talk slowly if you want this first first she has a list that disappears and
22:55
reappears and now what we had agreed upon was going to be a very simple trade
23:01
is not being very simple at all he's like I didn't I don't know if you guys are who you say you are I pull out the
23:12
gems and I say goddamnit
23:17
I can't do the Lisp I say sir sir um we
23:27
are who we said we were here's the payment we just want to verify that is
23:37
the proper egg before we hand over these gems okay look look look lady all right
23:46
I don't I don't have all day right we gotta get out of here and this is your
23:52
last chance either either we do the trade or I'm gonna walk with my egg
23:59
don't be hasty now so you want to place the egg down I toss you the gems and
24:06
then you leave correct I want to yep how about this you put the
24:13
egg down and you roll it towards us and then I throw you the Jim's that sounds
24:21

24:27
like same time simultaneous we're a scrambled egg so milady
24:33

24:39
inspect the egg to make sure it's genuine I will let you if you bring the
24:52
gems with you I will leave the gems
24:57
halfway between your group and ours I will come over by myself to check that I
25:04
attend the gems to him okay so so he's like all right all right we'll meet you
30:05
I’m holding my action," the Paladin shouted, gripping her warhammer. "If that drow caster starts weaving signs, I rush him." "Remember, a Ready action uses your Reaction," the DM warned. "And since you moved 20 feet already, you only have 10 feet of movement left to trigger with it." "That’s fine. I just need to get within range for Opportunity Attack threats.
30:00
I cast Shield to block the arrow!" "You can't," the Rogue pointed out. "You’re holding a focus in one hand and a torch in the other. Shield has Somatic components but no Material ones. You need a free hand unless you have the War Caster feat." "Damn. Okay, I drop the torch as a free object interaction first.
30:00
The lava pit is exactly 16 feet across. Can I make it?" "What’s your Strength score?" "It’s 16." "Then yes. Per Long Jump rules, if you move at least 10 feet before the jump, you cover a distance equal to your Strength score. You land on the very edge without needing an Athletics check.
30:00
The Rug of Smothering wraps around your face. You're suffocating." "I hold my breath!" "You can't; you were surprised. You have a Constitution modifier of +2. According to Suffocation rules, you survive for a number of rounds equal to your CON modifier. You have exactly two rounds to escape before you drop to 0 Hit Points automatically.
30:00
I’m tired of picking the lock. I hack the chest open with my Greataxe." "Okay. It’s a small, iron-bound chest. That gives it an Object AC of 15 and about 10 Hit Points." "I rolled a 12 damage." "It holds. Iron has a Damage Threshold. If you don't deal at least 10 damage after resistance, it takes nothing. But since you hit 12, you smash it.
30:00
The barn is pitch black. I can’t see Kotesh anywhere in the rafters," the Rogue whispered, squinting into the dark. "Don't light a torch," the Bard hissed. "If the buyer sees us, the Surprise round is ruined." "Too late. I hear goblins moving in the hay. Since I can’t see them in this darkness, my attack is going to have Disadvantage.
30:00
Doomguide Yovir is shouting! The goblin thief is scurrying through the Valhingen Graveyard with the jade!" "I loose an arrow at him before he reaches the crypts." "He just dove behind a heavy tombstone," the DM described. "That granite gives him enough Cover to deflect your shot. You hear the arrow spark against the stone rather than hitting the goblin.
30:00
Zern Xerkstil wants the package intact. I rush Borgas the bandit right on the edge of the Phlan harbor." "I want to shove him into the water." "Okay, make a Str (Athletics) check. If you beat his roll, he goes swimming." "Natural 20! Borgas flies off the dock, and the stolen dragon egg rolls safely to my feet.
30:00
We found the chest in Mantor’s Library, just like Aleyd Burral asked." "I check for traps before opening it." "Good idea. You spot a faint rune. If you had just opened it, the lightning damage would have been massive—enough to trigger Instant Death for a level 1 wizard like you." "I take a step back. Let the Rogue handle the Thieves' Tools check.
30:00
We need to sneak into the cellar of the Laughing Goblin to find the poison." "The Welcomers have thugs posted at the door. We all need to move quietly." "Since you're all moving together, this is a Group Stealth check. As long as the Ranger and Rogue roll high enough to cover the Paladin's clanking armor, you'll slip past the guards unnoticed.
